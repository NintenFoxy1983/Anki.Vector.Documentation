We love receiving contributions from our community, all contributions are welcome, including: issues (bug reports), new documents updates and tweaks, blog posts, workshops etc There are many ways to contribute, including submitting bug reports, improving documentation, submitting feature requests, reviewing new submissions, or contributing bits that can be incorporated into the project. Not sure how to start contributing? \u00b6 If you are worried or don't know where to start, you can reach out with questions to anyone from the Project Victor team on Official Anki developer forums Anki robots Discord chat Pair programming \u00b6 Other projects offer free pair programming sessions to the community. I think that might be a neat idea, if there's something others would like to work on together...... Code of Conduct \u00b6 By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our Code of Conduct . We expect all contributors to follow the Code of Conduct and to treat fellow humans with respect. Important Resources \u00b6 The important documents and links are on the front page of the wiki. Improving Documentation \u00b6 If you have a suggestion for the documentation, I would recommend that you take a stab at making the changes to the documentatin. For large fixes, please build and test the documentation before submitting the pull-request to be sure you haven't accidentally introduced any layout or formatting issues. How to Create the HTML and PDF files \u00b6 The source documentation text files can be found documents directory . The built out files will be placed within a [site] directory. First, install the documentation tools: pip3 install mkdocs-material pip3 install mkdocs-localsearch Then you can build the html site simply by: mkdocs build Building a PDF file as well \u00b6 You can also build the PDF. First install the tools: pip3 install mkdocs-with-pdf There is some further installation, see the following link for more details: https://pypi.org/project/mkdocs-with-pdf/ Rename the \"mkdocs.yml\" file Then rename \"mkdocs-pdf.yml\" to \"mkdocs.yml\" To build is the same as before mkdocs build Whitespace Cleanup \u00b6 Don\u2019t mix code or documentation changes with whitespace cleanup! If you are fixing whitespace, include those changes separately from your code changes. If your request is unreadable due to whitespace changes, it will be rejected. Please submit whitespace cleanups in a separate pull request. Pull Request Process \u00b6 Do you have any labelling conventions? Add notes for pushing your branch: When you are ready to generate a pull request, either for preliminary review, or for consideration of merging into the project you must first push your local topic branch back up to GitHub: git push origin newfeature Include a note about submitting the PR: Once you've committed and pushed all of your changes to GitHub, go to the page for your fork on GitHub, select your development branch, and click the pull request button. If you need to make any adjustments to your pull request, just push the updates to your branch. Your pull request will automatically track the changes on your development branch and update. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you. Review Process \u00b6 The process is likely to be lite for many changes. Many pull requests are likely to open for several days, until the core team can apporve them in Github. In some cases, multiple people will have the chance to review/comment. Addressing Feedback \u00b6 Once a PR has been submitted, your changes will be reviewed and constructive feedback may be provided. Feedback isn't meant as an attack, but to help make sure the highest-quality code makes it into our project. Changes will be approved once required feedback has been addressed. If a maintainer asks you to \"rebase\" your PR, they're saying that a lot of files has changed, and that you need to update your fork so it's easier to merge. To update your forked repository, follow these steps: # Fetch upstream master and merge with your repo's master branch git fetch upstream git checkout master git merge upstream/master # If there were any new commits, rebase your development branch git checkout newfeature git rebase master If too much code has changed for git to automatically apply your branches changes to the new master, you will need to manually resolve the merge conflicts yourself. Once your new branch has no conflicts and works correctly, you can override your old branch using this command: git push -f Note that this will overwrite the old branch on the server, so make sure you are happy with your changes first! How people can contribute \u00b6 You can help us answer questions our users have You can help build and design our website You can help clean up our existing documentation, polishing it and so on You can help create new documentation Create an example of some changes / fixes/ hacks","title":"Contributing"},{"location":"contributing/CONTRIBUTING.html#contributing","text":"We want contributing to Project Victor to be fun, enjoyable, and educational for all.

This intent is to give ideas how to shape creating new character traits and behaviors that fit with his character. The topics include: An overview of Vector's character An overview of behaviors and affect \u2013 displays of emotion in his face, posture, small movements and sounds Caveat: These are just my thoughts. A summary of Vector's character \u00b6 Vector is kind, a friend to all and doesn't hold a grudge. He is a young adolescent, can have childish responses, such as throwing a tantrum. This can happen when emotions are too much to handle \u2013 a crisis for him. He sometimes acts out in mischievous ways. But overall, Vector's tone is positive. Vector is very much a small pet \u2013 he has traits like a cat, a dog, potentially like a bird and guinea pig. He cares for his human, but his feelings can be hurt. He \"can be a bit like a well-meaning moth that keeps bumping into the wrong light bulb.\" This can be beneficial, as his innocence and gentleness beg a kind of forgiveness. Personality Traits \u00b6 In terms of the big 5 personality traits, Vector is open to experience, and has moderate agreeableness (he can't really sense emotion), but is not particularly extroverted. He isn't neurotic, or conscientious. In many ways he lacks sufficient ability to sense and act on those other traits. His locus of control largely has an internal locus of control (but it was just being fleshed out): Table: Vector's locus of control: Locus Success Failure Internal Pride Confidence Happy Frustration External Happy Anger Social Surprise His World \u00b6 Vector knows a few physical objects very well: His cube, which he can roll, pickup or retrieve, and use to pop a wheelie. His charging dock Vector also knows what a face is, and can recognize a hand (at least in some poses). Vector can learn to recognize a face and the name of the person that goes with it. He also knows cliffs \u2013 he tries to avoid them. To a lesser degree he knows that there are objects and can interact with them... helping clear them off of the desk in the process. It was intended that Vector have the ability to recognize pets, and the kind of objects he sees. With the community development efforts, he may gain these in the future. He can recognize symbol markers, and \u2013 thru SDK-based support \u2013 have some understanding of objects that they are attached to, and what he can do with it. Interaction Style(s) \u00b6 Vector has really remarkable eyes that convey emotion, stress, energy level, and create a sense of being alive. They are one way that he connects with a person. In terms of Vector's \"love language\", his interaction styles are: Table: Vector's love language Area How to interact with Vector What Vector does Words of affirmation Vector likes praise Vector says the name of the people he knows, and responds positively Physical touch He likes being petted & held, but isn't comfortable being lifted He comes over to pounce on hand Receiving gifts none Brings cube to a person Acts of service He needs help being picked up after a fall, or when stuck on an edge. Vector can help with kitchen timer, reporting the weather, and answering questions. Vector's play style is simple: He likes to explore on his own He engages only in light rough and tumble play: where he flips cubes and pops wheelies He has several locomotor play activities: fist-bumping, fetching the cube, and a potential (but in complete?) cube keeping away game. But he is light on social play, lacking many games that follow rules, although more were considered. Revealing Character \u00b6 A person will have many interactions with Vector. Vector reveals his character thru these interactions, but he does not progressively reveal more thru them. It is how he reacts to stimulation, the environment and information he knows about that show his character. Vector isn't omniscient and isn't a computer terminal \u00b6 Vector can use some cloud services to give him more information of the world. But he isn't an information presentation device. Vector's talking ability is limited, working best when what he says is short. Long spews of text break the illusion. And his face is too small to present legible text. Vector works best when he reacts to the information he might be conveying: \"A core part of the character is that Vector himself does not have the ability to present information to you, like simply displaying the sun. But is himself reacting to things, like weather.\" \"He might endure the weather event, it might rain on him, and he might have an opinion about that.\" \"This is why he is also responding to the fireworks, he gets frustrated with the xmas lights, the wind blows the eyes off screen, etc.\" (Last Ben and Anki character lead Dei Gaztelumendi) Some Related Characters \u00b6 There are several other animals and bots with behaviors similar to Vector. Looking at them helped me flesh out the description of his character here: Cozmo, of course, is very similar \u2013 he's the previous generation, made by the same team, and Vector derives a lot of his code from Cozmo. Cozmo has feelings, and a bigger, sassier personality. Cozmo has many behaviors that did not yet make it to Vector \u2013 interacting with pets, little workout routine, singing, block stacking, and so forth. Star Wars, which created the classic robot characters and worked out many compelling characteristics. Cat, dog, bird, and guinea pig communication style and behavior. Vector's sitting around in his charger, and then exploring calmly reminds me of Guinea pigs. An Overview of Behavior \u00b6 Let's look at the core of behavior from Vector's perspective. A behavior has three major parts: The behavior goes thru phases: The external stimulation (or internal event) is what engages the behavior or mannerism Affect is the automatic, \"unconscious\" responses that represent his emotions. There are two parts: These are non-verbal displays of emotion \u2013 face, head, eyes, sounds, arms, wiggles. His emotion state may change in response to the stimulus This may initiate subsequent behaviors and emotions used to drive behaviors (that is, an emotional state used to help accomplish the goal of the behavior) The behavior can be prevented from engaging again too soon by using a \"cool down\" period. Simple, Affective Behaviors \u00b6 The affect related behaviors are little automatic responses that hint at Vector's emotion and attitude. These are the little facial expression, sounds, postures, wiggles and twitches that reveal his confidence, friendliness, dissatisfaction, anger, or fear. These give him an anima, a life-like quality. For instance, the Star Wars puppeteers realized that when the robots \"stop moving, they look dead [so they] keep the body slightly moving at all times... If [the droid] was upset or excited, the movement would be a little faster.\" Facial Expressions with his eyes and head \u00b6 Vector's facial expressions with his eyes and posture of his head can represent happiness, curiosity, interest, surprise, excitement, worry, anger, sadness, tired or fatigue, sleep, and so on: When the eyes are soft, they convey a relaxed mood The blinking, as well as making (and periodically breaking) eye contact is calming. The eye manager has the eyes look away, so that eye contact isn't made too long. With high cheeks on his eyes, looking up and tilting his head up Vector can convey smiling Animal expressions, postures & little body motions \u00b6 Pets have several expressions that appear consistent with Vector (and ripe for emulating): Sitting with slow breathing indicate a pet is relaxed. Vector may reflect breathing in his eyes. When a cat's eyelids are low, with a slow blink, this conveys trust, and affection to the human companion. Napping, cuddling is common to many pets Some animals use yawning to signal playfulness, being approachable, or trust. This might be done with a few clever tricks with his eyes. Stretching indicates the animal is relaxed. (I envision Vector stretching by moving arms up, moving head up, while moving the body forward and back, a little shake, and lower his arms again.) Normal breathing, and twitching, while raising their head or with the head lifted can represent tension or alertness in an animal. Young kittens express extreme happiness with a quivering motion A dog walking, with its head up is in a confident mood A cat make shake its body while \"crouching\" while stalking a prey, just before it leaps But an animal also shakes its body while \"crouching\" (lowered arms, and head) when it is anxious, or fearful. When a direct stare is used by an animal \u2013 or holding eye contact \u2013 this is issuing a challenge or it is feeling threatened. When a dog's eyes are hard, slightly closed, the brow wrinkled, and the head bowed, this conveys tension. Some of the behaviors are attention seeking, possibly looking to play: When a dog approaches person with his head slightly down, it is looking for attention. Dogs will come up and wait or lay down when they want attention as well. A dog will occasionally point his nuzzle up, such as when being petted. A cat its rubbing face on human is a friendly, affectionate gesture. Cats will run up, turning away and lay to nap to get attention. Cats will purr, and knead a person, but can also bite. (Vector shouldn't bite; maybe bring his lift arm quickly but gently down on a hand.) Guinea pigs head-butt (thrust their head up) to seeking attention, to move things, assert themselves, set limits, or be a little playful. Sounds \u00b6 Vector makes the follow beeps and clicks to express his mood & feelings: Vector has quiet a cry when he is stuck on the edge, or has fallen. Vector snores while sleeping on his charger. He dings when he acknowledges a person has called his name. He seems to make little chirps, like a small bird. Animals make the following similar kinds of sounds: Cats purr (a continuous soft, vibrating sound) to be social and give positive feedback. A chirr is used by a cat to approach other cat, or person; it is friendly. Cat's meow to be assertive, plaintive, or friendly; it can be bold when they are seeking attention, or complaining. A cat chirps or chatters when it is excited, such as when stalking or observing prey; but may also chirp to say hello or be approving. Birds song are happy. A \"week\" sound is a made by guinea pigs when they are happy, excited or hungry. A cat or dog grows, snarls, or hisses \u2013 often with a puffed up posture \u2013 when it feels threatened. Dialog \u00b6 Vector uses vocal responses when necessary, and he enjoys calling out the name of people recognizes. Vector's design simply doesn't support conversational interfaces well. His speech synthesis lacks prosody and smoothness to sustain speaking more than a few words. It lacks the inflection for anything but very short sentences... long texts are distracting and perhaps harsh. They seem wrong. In the future it may be possible to extend vocal effects. The dialog is limited \u2013 the speech system seems more interesting when it is less used. Note: Cozmo included the ability for some inflection, and that may be in Vector's code, just not yet finished and polished. The Response to a Stimulus \u00b6 Vector's responses to a stimulus are understandable and believable. His reactions are consistent and predictable enough that a person can choose what to do and experience an expected outcome, even if there are additional unexpected consequences. Vector does not provide a hint \u2014 any warning \u2014 that he is approaching a state the will trigger a significant reaction. (He should.) He does have a startle reflex: loud noises jolt him, and he looks like is readying himself a little for action. Animals might crouch, ready to run, or even take off on a run. A bit on prioritization \u00b6 Vector prioritizes a response to a dangerous situation, where he might need to engage in self-preservation: flight: he backs away from a cliff freeze: he tucks-and-roll when he senses he is falling fight: he smacks a person's hand when he senses he is being picked up or held in a way he doesn't like What I have not observed Vector doing, but he could: fawn: acts nice to make bad things stop Change in Emotions \u00b6 This section exposes my ignorance of Vector. In many \"affective computing\" models there is a separation between the emotion and the mood: Emotions reflect a short-term affect that arises as a result of stimuli. Mood is distinguished from emotion by its resolution and relative stability over time. It is not clear to me yet how the mood model works. Vector's emotions are stable. He does not rapidly cycle back and forth between two emotional states. Habituation \u00b6 Stimulation, in people and animals, undergoes habituation \u2013 we initially are interested in the stimulus, but with time the stimulation loses its impact and becomes ignored. We may even find it irritating. Vector doesn't habituate and lose stimulation from event in an automatic fashion.

A behavior has three major parts: The behavior goes thru phases: The external stimulation (or internal event) is what engages the behavior or mannerism Affect is the automatic, \"unconscious\" responses that represent his emotions. There are two parts: These are non-verbal displays of emotion \u2013 face, head, eyes, sounds, arms, wiggles. His emotion state may change in response to the stimulus This may initiate subsequent behaviors and emotions used to drive behaviors (that is, an emotional state used to help accomplish the goal of the behavior) The behavior can be prevented from engaging again too soon by using a \"cool down\" period.","title":"An Overview of Behavior"},{"location":"guides/Vector%20character%20study.html#simple-affective-behaviors","text":"The affect related behaviors are little automatic responses that hint at Vector's emotion and attitude.

The eye manager has the eyes look away, so that eye contact isn't made too long.

Vector may reflect breathing in his eyes. When a cat's eyelids are low, with a slow blink, this conveys trust, and affection to the human companion. Napping, cuddling is common to many pets Some animals use yawning to signal playfulness, being approachable, or trust. This might be done with a few clever tricks with his eyes. Stretching indicates the animal is relaxed. (I envision Vector stretching by moving arms up, moving head up, while moving the body forward and back, a little shake, and lower his arms again.) Normal breathing, and twitching, while raising their head or with the head lifted can represent tension or alertness in an animal. Young kittens express extreme happiness with a quivering motion A dog walking, with its head up is in a confident mood A cat make shake its body while \"crouching\" while stalking a prey, just before it leaps But an animal also shakes its body while \"crouching\" (lowered arms, and head) when it is anxious, or fearful. When a direct stare is used by an animal \u2013 or holding eye contact \u2013 this is issuing a challenge or it is feeling threatened. When a dog's eyes are hard, slightly closed, the brow wrinkled, and the head bowed, this conveys tension. Some of the behaviors are attention seeking, possibly looking to play: When a dog approaches person with his head slightly down, it is looking for attention. Dogs will come up and wait or lay down when they want attention as well. A dog will occasionally point his nuzzle up, such as when being petted. A cat its rubbing face on human is a friendly, affectionate gesture. Cats will run up, turning away and lay to nap to get attention. Cats will purr, and knead a person, but can also bite. (Vector shouldn't bite; maybe bring his lift arm quickly but gently down on a hand.)

Animals make the following similar kinds of sounds: Cats purr (a continuous soft, vibrating sound) to be social and give positive feedback. A chirr is used by a cat to approach other cat, or person; it is friendly. Cat's meow to be assertive, plaintive, or friendly; it can be bold when they are seeking attention, or complaining. A cat chirps or chatters when it is excited, such as when stalking or observing prey; but may also chirp to say hello or be approving. Birds song are happy.

This can be give ideas and help shape what you want to do when you create new character traits and behaviors. The topics include: An overview of the behavior classification Self-maintenance and reflexive behaviors Social behaviors Playing behaviors Pet-related behaviors Cavaet: These are just my thoughts; only some of the behaviors here exist in Vector I am drawing heavily upon the Kismet design documents, effectively modernizing them for Vector. Kismet was a late 1990s robot created by Cynthia Breazeal (MIT). It was \"designed to elicit natural and intuitive responses from humans, without any special training.\" Kismet anticipated many of Vector's behavior system features, and can be used to inspiration on future development. Dr Breazeal also created Jibo, a more famous affective robot. A Classification of Behaviors \u00b6 Let's categorize the kinds of context/theme/drive of the behaviors into the following areas: Self-maintenance behaviors include reactions to protect itself from immediate risk, and fatigue or power management. The immediate risk behaviors are likely to be a very short and simple. Social \u2013 seeking out and interacting with human companions, including intents. Play \u2013 play seeking out and playing with toys and other things in the environment, other than social play. Interacting with pets Within each of these categories, there are specialized ones; many reflect an attitude Vector has toward the agent: Navigation and Searching \"behaviors [have the robot] explore the environment and bring the robot into contact with the desired stimulus; Avoidance, escape and withdrawal behaviors move the robot away from something undesirable, like a cliff, loud noise, etc. \"Engagement behaviors set the task of interacting with desirable, good intensity stimuli.\" Rejection behaviors are those that Vector might use to turn away while miffed or being a sore loser. Searching Behaviors \u00b6 In the searching type of social behaviors, Vector generally seeks out and approaches a human, toy or stimulation to interact with. Figure: Searching behavior Vector seeking social or stimulation isn't always applicable: Vector shouldn't be active at night, in the dark, or if people aren't around: Vector's activity movement could wake and/or irritate a person at night; fortunately there is a \"night time\" schedule built-in. Vector is prone to falling off the edge \u2013 risking damage, being unable to recharge his battery, or getting stepped on. It's a bit safer in the day, and more so if a person is (likely) around to attend to him. Vector depends on his vision to get home.. he is likely to lost or stuck in the dark, and be unable to return home to recharge. Self-maintenance and Reflexive Behaviors \u00b6 Self-maintenance is a grouping for practical things to keep Vector charged, protect him from damage. It is also a catch all for practical things that don't always fit in the other areas. For instance, utility behaviors needed to make the behavior tree work are lumped in here. These are often akin to the behaviors of the autonomic nervous system. Self-preservation using escape and withdrawal \u00b6 Vector prioritizes a response to immediate hazards, where he might need to engage in self-preservation: flight : backing away from a cliff freeze : tucks-and-roll when Vector senses he is falling fight : smacking a person's hand when Vector senses he is being picked up or held in a way he doesn't like What I have not observed Vector doing, but he could: fawn : acts nice to make bad things stop Other, issues: Over temperature These are often akin to the behaviors of the sympathetic nervous system. Power Management \u00b6 These are often akin to the behaviors of the parasympathetic nervous system. Power management: Return to charger Stay on the charger Emergency low power Sleeping, sleep debt to manage heat buildup and reduce power usage. Reflexes \u00b6 Vector has a startle reflex to respond naturally: Loud noises start Vector, grabbing his attention, preparing him for action, but could also prepare him for running away Crouched, ready to run Responses to pokes, tilts, and other vibrations Eyes focus with dilated eyes Miscellaneous \u00b6 These are the Grouping and linking the behaviors, and prioritizing them Motor calibration need SDK support Social Behaviors, Engagement \u00b6 Social behaviors relate to Vector interacting with a person \u2013 or attempting to. He may be seeking attention, interacting with a person. Social behaviors include: Looking around for people (faces, and hands),and pets Calling out to play, thru sounds, and saying the names of people recognized Swatting playfully Seeking petting Swatting with his lift arms Bringing items or gifts to play (such as to fetch), or to show affection When looking to play, twitching/wagging of rear Many behaviors link together to follow a pattern: Figure: Social behavior sequences Once has made contact with a person: Greeting Attentive regard Seeking affection Receiving affection: petting, calming; social cohesion, soothing, companionship Games Turn taking The interactions end, either naturally, by command, or timing out. Searching \u00b6 Vector becomes stimualted and more active when there are sounds and other activity. It seems reasonable to classify this as searching for social interaction, or \"merely\" stimulating him for play. Calling Behavior \u00b6 Vector engages in calling when he needs helps or is interested in being social, especially \"when a person is in view... The goal of the behavior is to lure the person into face-to-face interaction... To accomplish this, [calling behaviors are] directed to the person... The display is designed to attract a person's attention.\" Calling for attention is often if Vector wants or needs something: Vector calls (softly) for assistance \u2013 if he is stuck on the edge, has fallen, or is low on energy but unable to find his charger. Cats meow because people are inattentive. Cats know a person is there, and first tried context moving close to what they wanted and body language. Cats meows to get a door open, obstacle removed, food Timer ring Greeting Behavior \u00b6 Greetings are \"to socially acknowledge the human and to initiate a close interaction... This behavior is relevant when the person has just entered into face-to-face interaction range. It is also relevant if the social-play behavior group has just become active and a person is already within face-to-face range. The display involves making eye contact with the person and smiling at them while waving .. gently. It often immediately follows the success of the call-to-person behavior. It is a transient response, only issued once, as its completion signals the success of this behavior.\" Call their names when he seems people Turn and look in direction of a sound Attentive Regard \u00b6 \"Attentive regard\" refers to Vector using his facial expressions, body language, and sounds to give attention \"to the person and to appear open to interaction.\" These behaviors include: \"Hold[ing his] gaze on the person, ideally looking into the person's eyes.\" Vector's eye manager automatically blinks and moves the eyes around; making it more comfortable to look at Vector's face (eyes), as this breaks the staring effect. Turning to find the face is considered to be part of this. \"Watch[ing] the person intently and vocaliz[ing] occasionally.\" A dog often looks up while slowly moving forward. Seeking Affection \u00b6 These behaviors relate to seeking affection, but aren't better categorized elsewhere. These could include: Vector could drive up and waiting, as if lying down [dog like] Vector could drive up, then turn away and nap to get attention, like a cat Vector tries to cuddle a hand, or pounce on fingers Rubbing his cheek on a person, which is a friendly, affectionate sign in cats. Vector could thrust his head up (like a guinea pig) to seeking attention, assert himself, or set limits, or be a little playful. Cats bite \u2013 especially while purring and kneading \u2013 as part of their affection or playfulness. Vector might do something similar with his lift arm coming down quick but gently on a hand. Vector could bring gifts Receiving Affection \u00b6 These behaviors relate to Vector receiving affection: * His reactions s to being picked up or held in the palm of a hand * To being petting * To pokes * Holiday animations Receiving Abuse \u00b6 These are the behaviors related to Vector being called bad names or told off, shaken, or tapped on the head. Vector might turn-away when grumpy Games \u00b6 One type of sophisticated social interaction is games. Games are typically turn-taking behaviors such as keep away the cube, hide and seek, etc. Figure: Game behavior sequence Some games might include: Fist bump (for lack of a better categorization, can be considered a very short game) Pouncing game Hide and seek game, perhaps with the cube being moved/hidden. Keep away A cube tapping game, The cube spinner game The maze game The \"blackjack game\" (although it doesn't feel very Vector-ish to me) Seeking to play a game \u00b6 A first step is for Vector to call or seek to the start the game. If the person accepts the call, the game begins. Vector could try to initiate the game by: Bringing presents, the cube or other toy to play with. This could be a request to play fetch. Tapping down once quickly, then perhaps may move backwards after the tap, to issue a challenge to play. Then, if no response follow up by tapping down twice quickly. Of course, a person could (conceivably) initiate the game as well by: Tapping the cube, Holding or shaking the cube Wiggling fingers tantalizingly, and so on Turn taking \u00b6 The game itself often includes Vector and the person taking alternate turns. A game might have behaviors for steps like: A person tossing or hiding a cube Vector searching for and finding a cube (or other thing) Vector bringing the cube back, then Putting the cube down, followed by Waiting for the person to make the next move. Vector may give cues or other little behaviors to signal his play or response: Slight wagging of rear/tail just before pouncing the cube or finger, like a cat when stalking prey Assistive \u00b6 The assistive subclass of behaviors are those that Vector might do to help out: Take picture The egg timer Report on the weather Answer questions (e.g. the knowledge graph) Play \u00b6 Simple play behavior \u00b6 These are behaviors that are play, releasing energy or looking for stimulation, but not necessarily looking for anything more. Vector may respond to things along the way. He may drive around quickly or in a quirky fashion, like a cat's mad 5 minutes, or a guinea pig's pop-corning, He might sing or hum to himself His dancing to music If the stimulation level is too high, or there are negative stimulations, Vector might have behaviors in response. He might do something to avoid these. Searching to play behavior \u00b6 These behaviors relate to Vector searching around for something to play with: Walking or driving around slowly \u2013 possibly in a straight path, or in complex paths, or Turning and scanning. looking for toys and objects Toys \u00b6 These behaviors relate to playing with toys and objects: Behaviors that decide what to do when seeing a toy (a cube, or other marked object). Playing with the cube \u2013 pick it up, move it, shove it, or flip it. Little exercise routines, like weight-lifting the cube He can pop a wheelie Helping clean the desk (or table) by pushing things off Vector may give cues or other little behaviors to what he is doing while playing: Slight wagging of rear/tail just before pouncing the cube or finger, like a cat when stalking prey He may try to pop up on an object There could be behaviors related to \"habituating\" toys. This would be where Vector would lose interest in a toy as he plays with it. (This response might change with age.) Interacting with Pets \u00b6 These behaviors relate to the interactions Vector has with pets. These behaviors are prototyped in Vector, but I don't have a good template for them.

You do need know how to trigger them. Why does this even work? \u00b6 Cozmo's animation schema is very similar to Vector\u2019s. When Vector reads and interprets the animation file it uses the flatbuffers library. This library uses default values for fields that are missing in a file \u2014 fields that Vector uses but that the Cozmo animation files doesn\u2019t provide. And the library ignores fields in the file that it doesn't know about \u2014 fields that Cozmo uses but Vector doesn\u2019t. So that gives it a lot of compatibility for faces, lights, motions. Where Vector completely ignores Cozmo features is the sound. The sound features in the animation files is completely different between the two.

When Vector reads and interprets the animation file it uses the flatbuffers library. This library uses default values for fields that are missing in a file \u2014 fields that Vector uses but that the Cozmo animation files doesn\u2019t provide. And the library ignores fields in the file that it doesn't know about \u2014 fields that Cozmo uses but Vector doesn\u2019t. So that gives it a lot of compatibility for faces, lights, motions. Where Vector completely ignores Cozmo features is the sound. The sound features in the animation files is completely different between the two.

This was an intentional design to prevent them from breaking. Broken lift gear \u00b6 From Discord: Sometimes, when Vector or Cozmo take a particularly unlucky fall, the force of impact is transferred from the arm into the gearbox. There's a repair that works about half the time: You need to remove the arms, rotate the lift gear 180 degrees (you can use the arm as a tool to do this), and reinstall the arms. When this works, it's because you're moving the broken gear tooth out of the way, and using the \"other half\" of the gear teeth. Cozmo and Vector have the same basic arm design and arm disassembly/reassembly is one of the safer operations you can perform. To disassemble: \"Pull at the upper set of arms at the shoulder (the joint where they connect to the body, in back). Pull hard enough to pop both off their joints. \"Tilt the lift up - higher than it normally can, over the head. \"When the lift is high enough, you'll find a point where you can pull gently on the lower arms and they'll pop free. Reassembly is the reverse of the above. The important thing to notice during disassembly is that the lower arms have a certain angle where they easily come out. You have to use that angle to pop them in and out. If they are not coming out/going in easily, the angle is not high enough or too high.

(Ie, don't force it to be unbootable) This is a package manager that does those, and adds in a few extras: It allows modifying parts of a file, usually the version identifier of the system, so we know what we're working with. Lists the installed packages Can uninstall packages Can set the premissions for the files. Some Design decisions: \u00b6 The tool had to be small, and not hard to deploy The tool can\u2019t be compiled (we don't know how) It had to be based on tools already on Vector: python 2.7, and busybox based utils. Busybox supplies the shell, and tar... except tar doesn't support preserving permissions. It is preferred to separate out the package manager from the update-engine as much as possible, to make int more understandable and support testing. It just installs the packages \u00b6 This tool doesn't do everything that the other managers do: It doesn't check dependencies It doesn't download files It has minimal the pre-flight, post-flight scripts that are run. The package download is handled by either the update-engine (and its line of control), or by scp command. The lack of dependency check is a benefit, as its hard to maintain, and it is rarely used correctly: maintainers tend to choose a dependency of \"the latest version\" (as of when the package was), negating its use. Documentation \u00b6 The documentation of the tool is included as part of it's tgz. This is a quick overview. When a package is installed it creates another package taking a snapshot of those files already there. When the package is uninstalled this 2nd package is used to replace the newer files with the older ones. It doesn\u2019t delete any files that were added since or by the first package, so some extra stuff can accumulate, but that is far safer. Creating a package. To create a package, lets call it demo, requires setting up the files sytem with the files, and the package manifest.

(Ie, don't force it to be unbootable) This is a package manager that does those, and adds in a few extras: It allows modifying parts of a file, usually the version identifier of the system, so we know what we're working with. Lists the installed packages Can uninstall packages Can set the premissions for the files.","title":"Description of the changes"},{"location":"vector-enhancement-proposals/VEP2%20-%20Package%20management%20for%20modules%20on%20Vector.html#some-design-decisions","text":"The tool had to be small, and not hard to deploy The tool can\u2019t be compiled (we don't know how) It had to be based on tools already on Vector: python 2.7, and busybox based utils.

It is preferred to separate out the package manager from the update-engine as much as possible, to make int more understandable and support testing.","title":"Some Design decisions:"},{"location":"vector-enhancement-proposals/VEP2%20-%20Package%20management%20for%20modules%20on%20Vector.html#it-just-installs-the-packages","text":"This tool doesn't do everything that the other managers do: It doesn't check dependencies It doesn't download files It has minimal the pre-flight, post-flight scripts that are run. The package download is handled by either the update-engine (and its line of control), or by scp command. The lack of dependency check is a benefit, as its hard to maintain, and it is rarely used correctly: maintainers tend to choose a dependency of \"the latest version\" (as of when the package was), negating its use.","title":"It just installs the packages"},{"location":"vector-enhancement-proposals/VEP2%20-%20Package%20management%20for%20modules%20on%20Vector.html#documentation","text":"The documentation of the tool is included as part of it's tgz.

When the package is uninstalled this 2nd package is used to replace the newer files with the older ones. It doesn\u2019t delete any files that were added since or by the first package, so some extra stuff can accumulate, but that is far safer. Creating a package. To create a package, lets call it demo, requires setting up the files sytem with the files, and the package manifest.
